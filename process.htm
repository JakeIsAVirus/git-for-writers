				<p>In this scenario, an exercise is presented that will help pull together the concepts discussed previously and allow for hands-on practice. This project will be most effective if a team of four is formed. For the purposes of this exercise, you will need to refer to previous documentation, for greater detail specific to github commands. </p>

<p>Although there is strong support for non-linear development within Git (through rapid branching and merging), this project follows a rather straightforward publishing process with a managing editor controlling the various stages of editorial development.</p>

<p><b>Step 1.</b> The scenario involves a linear publishing process whereby a team of four individuals are working independently to create an XHTML tagged text file that any writer could download and start writing within. A CSS template file also needs to be created so that none of the writers worry about the formatting of their content.</p>

<p>A managing editor will oversee the entire process, but will rely on the three writers to create the content and load into the Git repository within Github. The editor will then pull the content down once he/she approves of the version for others to access and further revise.</p>

<p>Three chapters need to be written by separate writers: 1) a marketing chapter with a purpose narrative on why writers should utilize the Git technology and their proposed workflow process; 2) a chapter on GitHub commands specific to the publishing industry; and, 3) a setting up Github (for the first steps in the process) which include basic navigational commands: push/pull, merge, revision history, etc.</p>

<p>As the chapters are written, marketing’s narrative is validated and the commands are practiced by the writers as they execute what they write. The writers and managing editor will ensure quality control is in place as they work through the process of creating this content for electronic publication.</p>

<p><b>Step 2</b>.
Each individual participating in this exercise should setup a Github account. Follow the instructions within the tutorial and access Github at http://github.com. Don’t forget to provide Git your name and email address so your future commits are associated with your name and email.</p>

<p>The project member selected to be the managing editor should create the Github repository. In addition to the tutorial within the documentation preceding this project, another reference is the Git Community Book: The open Git resource pulled together by the whole community, “Chapter 3: Basic Usage” for information on how to obtain a Git repository. </p>

<p>You can either clone a repository or initialize one. Don’t forget to review “git init” and “git clone” commands.</p>

<p><b>Step 3. </b>Once everyone has an account and a repository is in place. Each writer should begin researching and writing their topic. An XHTML tagged text file should be used by everyone within the project to ensure common format structure.</p>

<p>Each writer will need to commit their changes to the repository in at least two intervals: referred to as 1st Pass and 2nd Pass in the graphic accompanying these instructions.</p>

<p>Writers will either add a new file or stage an existing file and then commit (“git add” versus “git commit” commands). Refer to earlier documentation for instructions on how to Stage a file for a Commit.</p>
